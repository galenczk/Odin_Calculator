TO-DO <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Make sure decimal works as an input to start new operations.

Display operations as they are input and their result.

Write logic for clear and delete buttons.

Write logic for signSwitch button.

Decimals should be rounded for simplicity and to fit on the screen.

Add keyboard support. Look to Wes Bos drumkit.

Fix up an aesthetic for the whole thing.

Change any if (boolean === true) to just if(boolean).

BUGS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

If 0. is used as input, the decimal disappears when numbers are input after it.

Decimals do not work at all.

If inputDisplay only contains one 0, pressing 0 should do nothing.

Pressing a operator after a calculation has been completed should display the
calculated result and the new operator.
