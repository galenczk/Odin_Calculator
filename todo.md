Users should be able to repeatedly click equals and apply the last calculation
to its result.

Users should be able to change operator before hitting equals.

Fix up an aesthetic for the whole thing.

Decimals should be rounded for simplicity and to fit on the screen.

Pressing clear should clear all variables.

Add a backspace button that will delete a single character, but not alter
variable values.

Add keyboard support. Look to Wes Bos drumkit.

I would largely start over, scrap the large ideas of matching Window's
calculator functionallity, and stick to the requirements of the project. Maybe
try to make this stand out with aesthetic...
